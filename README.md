# Employee Layoff Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of employee layoffs using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal was to understand how workforce, organizational, and performance-related factors can be used to identify employees who may be at higher risk during workforce reductions.

The project combines data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling to support data-driven workforce planning and risk assessment.

## Objective
To build a predictive model that estimates layoff risk at an individual level using historical and organizational data, helping organizations make more informed and transparent decisions.

## Problem Context
Layoffs are often influenced by multiple factors such as role criticality, performance, tenure, and organizational conditions. Manually assessing these risks can be inconsistent and biased. This project explores how data-driven approaches can assist in identifying patterns associated with layoff risk.

## Approach
- Analyzed employee-level and organizational data
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and relationships
- Applied preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values and feature encoding
- Trained machine learning models to predict layoff risk
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Data visualization libraries
- Machine learning classification techniques

## Key Features
- End-to-end data preprocessing and analysis pipeline
- Identification of important features influencing layoff risk
- Predictive modeling for employee-level risk estimation
- Clear separation between data analysis and model development stages

## Key Learnings
- Applying machine learning to workforce and HR analytics
- Handling structured organizational data
- Interpreting model outputs in a business context
- Understanding ethical considerations in predictive workforce analytics

## Use Case
This project demonstrates how predictive analytics can be applied in HR and workforce management to support risk assessment, planning, and decision-making during organizational restructuring.
